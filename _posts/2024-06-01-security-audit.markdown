description: Conducted a controls and compliance assessment and provided recommendations to company stakeholders to mitigate risks and avoid fines based on best practices for NIST CSF, PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC 1 & SOC 2.
--- . My findings indicate a high-risk environment with inadequate controls and compliance measures, leaving the company vulnerable to security breaches and potential fines.

I've outlined detailed recommendations in my report, prioritizing immediate implementation of confidentiality controls (least privilege, password policies, separation of duties, encryption), proactive system management plans (disaster recovery, legacy system management, IDS, password management), and proper asset classification. These actions will significantly mitigate risks, improve security posture, and ensure business continuity.
